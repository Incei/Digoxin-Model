## Digoxin-Model
Whole-body PBPK model of digoxin as P-gp DDI victim drug

### Repository files
Within this repository, we distribute a whole-body PBPK model of digoxin, that has been carefully developed using a large number of clinical studies and evaluated within our DDI modeling network. 

The PK-Sim project file contains simulations of all published clinical studies employed during model establishment, including the respective observed data digitized from literature reports. For further details, quantitative model evaluation, sensitivity analysis and extensive documentation please refer to [[1](#reference)].
